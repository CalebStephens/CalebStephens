Check out my pinned repo's to see some of what I have been working on:

NodeJS-Express-Pub-Quiz-App - A backend app which allows users to sign up, sign in with authentication. Has functionality for quizzez to be played and created along with date validation and scoring. Quiz data is pulled from OpenTBD when ever a quiz is created by a superadmin user. Data is stored on render. 

React-NextJS-HackerNews-App - A frontend app focused on using both SSR and CSR, pulling data from the Hacker News Api. The project was focused on the functionality rather then design.
